# Description

Below are my projects using common LLM APIs like HuggingFace, OpenAI, Gradio (for the UI chatbot) and others. For project number 2, I used Google Colab to run the code on GPUs.

#### Project 1: MultiModalChatbot.ipynb

In this code, I created a Multi Modal chatbot UI:
  - the user can save his request vocally
  - the chatbot with respond in a text format on the left box
  - Another chatbot will translate the answer in the left box on the right box (in japanese)

#### Project 2: DatasetGenerator.ipynb

In this code, I created a chatbot specialized in dataset generation where the user can ask for any new dataset in whatever format she/he wants.
