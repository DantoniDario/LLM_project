      "In **2009**, Federer finally achieved the career Grand Slam by winning the French Open, defeating Robin Soderling in the final. The victory was especially sweet, as Nadal—Federer’s nemesis on clay—had been upset earlier in the tournament. Later that year, Federer also reclaimed Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras’ record of 14 Grand Slam titles.  \n",
      "\n",
      "But setbacks followed. Federer’s ranking dipped, and critics speculated about his decline. Djokovic, in particular, began to dominate in the early 2010s. Federer endured heartbreaks, including losses in several Slam semifinals and finals. Yet his resilience and love for the game kept him going.\n",

      "In **2003**, Federer achieved his first Grand Slam title at **Wimbledon**, defeating Mark Philippoussis in the final. His victory was decisive, and it marked the beginning of an era. Federer’s combination of elegance, precision, and power captivated fans and pundits alike. Unlike many modern players, who relied on baseline attrition, Federer embraced an all-court style—attacking the net, slicing deftly, and striking winners with seemingly effortless grace.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The following years brought dominance rarely seen in tennis. Between **2004 and 2007**, Federer won 11 Grand Slam titles, including multiple Wimbledons, US Opens, and Australian Opens. He held the **world No. 1 ranking** for a record 237 consecutive weeks (2004–2008). During this period, Federer’s superiority was nearly absolute: he won tournaments on every surface, crushed rivals with consistency, and developed an aura of invincibility.\n",

      "Federer announced his official retirement in September 2022, closing a career that spanned over two decades.

His rivalry with Nadal and Djokovic elevated men’s tennis to unprecedented popularity, inspiring a generation of players and fans.  \n",

      "A renaissance came in **2017**, when Federer, then 35, returned from injury to win the Australian Open. In the final, he defeated Nadal in a five-set thriller, reigniting their rivalry. That season, he also won Wimbledon, capturing his 19th Grand Slam. The comeback was hailed as one of the most remarkable in sports history, demonstrating Federer’s adaptability, longevity, and enduring brilliance.  \n",

His **one-handed backhand**, though once seen as a weakness against heavy topspin, evolved into a weapon, particularly after his 2017 resurgence. Federer’s **serve**, though not the fastest, was exceptionally precise, often setting up easy points.\n",
